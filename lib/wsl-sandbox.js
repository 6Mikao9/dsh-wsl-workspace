* The WSL world's `sandbox` capability.
*
* DSH's confinement seam wraps a command so the host's runner enforces the file
* policy. That runner describes Windows paths: asked to confine a command whose
* policy carries a `\\wsl.localhost\…` workspace root it fails outright
* (`GetNamedSecurityInfoW failed (Win32 1)` — the ACL of a 9P path cannot be
* read), and even where it worked it could not bound a process that executes on
* the Linux kernel side. That is why this plugin's bash tool has never gone
* through it, and why the host's persistent-shell group cannot be reused as-is:
* its backend calls `sandbox.confine()` before spawning.
*
* So the world declares its own provider: commands run unconfined by the
* Windows runner — the distribution is the boundary — while the file tools keep
* enforcing the policy themselves, at the resolved real path, in
* `src/fs.ts`. `enforcement: 'partial'` records that split honestly: within this
* world the policy is enforced for file effects, not by the wrapped command.
*
