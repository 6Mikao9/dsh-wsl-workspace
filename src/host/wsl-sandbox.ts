/**
 * The WSL world's `sandbox` capability.
 *
 * DSH's confinement seam wraps a command so the host's runner enforces the file
 * policy. That runner describes Windows paths: asked to confine a command whose
 * policy carries a `\\wsl.localhost\…` workspace root it fails outright
 * (`GetNamedSecurityInfoW failed (Win32 1)` — the ACL of a 9P path cannot be
 * read), and even where it worked it could not bound a process that executes on
 * the Linux kernel side. That is why this plugin's bash tool has never gone
 * through it, and why the host's persistent-shell group cannot be reused as-is:
 * its backend calls `sandbox.confine()` before spawning.
 *
 * So the world declares its own provider: commands run unconfined by the
 * Windows runner — the distribution is the boundary — while the file tools keep
 * enforcing the policy themselves, at the resolved real path, in
 * `src/fs.ts`. `enforcement: 'partial'` records that split honestly: within this
 * world the policy is enforced for file effects, not by the wrapped command.
 *
