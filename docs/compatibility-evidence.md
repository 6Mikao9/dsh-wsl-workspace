# DSH release compatibility evidence

The `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` records in `package.json` are backed by the
reproducible procedure in `scripts/verify-dsh-compat.sh`. Re-run it before
changing any declaration:

scripts/verify-dsh-compat.sh 0.1.0-rc.7 0.1.0-rc.8 0.1.1-rc.1 0.1.1-rc.2 0.1.2-rc.1
## Method

For every declared release the script:

1. installs the published `@deepseek-ai/dsh@<version>` into an isolated temp
   prefix (never the live installation);
2. redirects `DSH_HOME` to a fresh temp tree and picks an unused port, so the
   live profile and the running harness are untouched;
3. runs `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-wsl-workspace` (the normal user
   install path);
4. boots `dsh web --port <port>`, requires the web UI to serve, the plugin's
   `POST /wsl-workspace/api` to answer `200`, and the boot log to be free of
   plugin errors;
5. runs `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-wsl-workspace`, boots again, and
   requires the plugin route to be gone (clean uninstall).

A release is declared `compatible` only when install, start, and uninstall all
hold. Any failure would be declared `unknown` together with the failing step.

## Results (2026-09-03, plugin 0.4.1, Windows 11 + WSL2 Ubuntu)
| DSH release | install | start (route 200, no plugin errors) | uninstall (route gone) | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1.0-rc.7 | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ (route 405) | compatible |
| 0.1.0-rc.8 | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ (route gone) | compatible |
| 0.1.1-rc.1 | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | compatible |
| 0.1.1-rc.2 | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | compatible |
| 0.1.2-rc.1 | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | compatible |
All five boots produced logs without a single `dsh-wsl-workspace` error line;
the verification transcript (per-version `boot-with-plugin.log`,
`boot-without-plugin.log`, `plugin-add.log`, `plugin-remove.log`) is retained
in the runner's temp directory by the script and printed as a summary table of
`<version> PASS compatible` lines at the end.

## Follow-up verification (2026-09-10, plugin 0.4.2)

`0.1.3-alpha.1` is gone from the declaration: npm publishes no
`@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.3-alpha.1` (`npm view` answers 404), so that entry could
never be verified by the procedure above. The published `0.1.3-alpha.2` takes its
place; every other declared release is unchanged.

Each declared release was re-verified on the isolated-case harness
(`scripts/compatibility/`), which pins every `dsh-*` dependency of the target
release and installs the plugin with its peers resolved from that same runtime:

```powershell
& ./scripts/compatibility/Prepare-Case.ps1 -Version '<release>' -RunId '<id>' -Port <port>
& ./scripts/compatibility/Start-Case.ps1 -Manifest '<case>/runtime.json'
& ./scripts/compatibility/Run-Checks.ps1  -Manifest '<case>/runtime.json'
```

| DSH release | boot | `POST /wsl-workspace/api` | checks exit 0 | Create & open: workspace `sessionIds` | session variant |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1.0-rc.7 | ok | `listDistros` | 9/10 | non-empty | `wsl-standard` |
| 0.1.0-rc.8 | ok | `listDistros` | 9/10 | not exercised | - |
| 0.1.1-rc.1 | ok | `listDistros` | 9/10 | not exercised | - |
| 0.1.1-rc.2 | ok | `listDistros` | 9/10 | non-empty | `wsl-standard` |
| 0.1.2-rc.1 | ok | `listDistros` | 9/10 | non-empty | `wsl-standard` |
| 0.1.3-alpha.2 | ok | `listDistros` | 9/10 | non-empty | `wsl-standard` |

`typecheck` is the tenth check and the only non-zero one; it sits at its
pre-existing baseline (module resolution for peers that exist only inside a DSH
install, plus the older `src/fs.ts` / `src/host/wsl-skills.ts:294,366` /
`tests/*` findings, none of them on a line this plugin's changes touch).

Create & open is asserted server-side rather than from the dialog: the workspace
record must carry the new session id, and the session log must contain
`agent-preset/selected` with `wsl-standard`. On the base commit `0.1.2-rc.1` left
`sessionIds` empty here - the workspace was created, no session was opened, and
the dialog reported success, because the plugin had cached its `uiWorkspace`
lookup at apply time, before that service existed.

### Model turn on 0.1.2-rc.1 (real API, final build)

One turn in a WSL workspace holding `offbyone-skill` (UTF-8 BOM, body on the line
immediately after the closing `---`) and a no-BOM control:

- `skill {name: "offbyone-skill"}` delivered
  `<skill_instructions>\nOFFBYONE-MARKER-Z9Q7\nsecond line\n</skill_instructions>`
  - the body's first character is intact and the BOM is stripped;
- `bash uname -sr; pwd` answered `Linux 6.18.33.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2` and
  `/home/mille/fu-rc1`;
- `write` + `read` round-tripped `notes/probe.txt` as `WSL-WRITE-OK`, and an
  independent `stat` from inside the distribution reported `644 mille`.
